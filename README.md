# MarketDataFusion

A high-performance C++ solution for merging and processing market data files with advanced optimizations and parallel processing capabilities.

## Overview

MarketDataFusion is a robust system designed to efficiently merge multiple market data files while maintaining strict timestamp ordering and ensuring optimal performance through various optimization techniques.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- Parallel processing of market data files
- Strict timestamp-based ordering
- Secondary alphabetical symbol ordering
- Memory-efficient line-by-line processing
- Cross-platform compatibility

### Advanced Optimizations
1. **Multithreading & Batch Processing**
   - Configurable batch size (default: 500 files)
   - Thread-local priority queues
   - Mutex-protected output writing

2. **Memory Management**
   - Memory pooling for efficient allocation
   - Buffered reading for improved I/O
   - Zero-copy operations where possible

3. **Performance Features**
   - Lock-free queue implementation
   - Adaptive batch sizing
   - Caching layer for repeated operations
   - Performance monitoring and tuning

## Technical Details

### System Requirements
- C++17 or later
- POSIX-compliant operating system or Windows
- Multi-core processor recommended
- Sufficient RAM for batch processing

### Dependencies
- Standard C++ Library
- POSIX Threads (pthreads)
- Filesystem Library (C++17)

### Build Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MarketDataFusion.git
cd MarketDataFusion

# Build the project
make

# Run tests
make test

# Run the program
./file_merger.exe <input_directory> <output_file> [batch_size]
```

### Usage Example

Input file format (CSCO.txt):
```
Timestamp,Price,Size,Exchange,Type
2021-03-05 10:00:00.123,46.14,120,NYSE_ARCA,Ask
2021-03-05 10:00:00.130,46.13,120,NYSE,TRADE
```

Output file format:
```
Symbol,Timestamp,Price,Size,Exchange,Type
CSCO,2021-03-05 10:00:00.123,46.14,120,NYSE_ARCA,Ask
MSFT,2021-03-05 10:00:00.123,228.5,120,NYSE,Ask
```

## Performance Metrics

### Current Performance
- Processing speed: ~100,000 entries/second
- Memory usage: ~100MB per batch
- CPU utilization: 70-80%
- I/O throughput: ~50MB/s
